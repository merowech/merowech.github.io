        "description": "I am interested in artificial intelligence and security, especially deep learning and cybersecurity, but also predictive policing and machine learning in general. My current research revolves around a visualized understanding of deep neural networks (explainable AI) for time series data to enable explainbility and debugging of deep learning models.",

Discussing the technical and ethical limitations around AI is another aspect I like. This includes what AI can learn from human behavior and how we could model human behavior using AI models.",
